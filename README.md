# Arena
A WIP pvp minigame which uses a unique draft-based system to allow players to build out their playstyle, inventory and abilities.

As it's currently envisioned, the first phase of the game will entail a 'drafting',
in which each player is shown the inside of a 'crate' of loot. That player must then
pick a single item from the amongst the loot. Once each player has picked, the draft
will 'rotate' clockwise and a player will see the crate that had been opened by the
player on their right.

This will continue until all crates are empty and all items have been picked. There
will be three repitions of this; one for weapons/offensive items, another for armor,
and the last for acccessary items such as food, potions and unique abilities.

Once the game begins, it's a free-for-all and the last player alive wins. Loot is
dropped on death, and there also will be an in-game crafting system that allows
limited progression during the game as players kill other players and pick up loot.

Tentative: There *may* be classes, adding more strategy and relevance of choice
to the draft in that players will need to draft items that specifically benefit
the playstyle of their choice.

Tentative #2: An alternate mode of this game could/might exist, a 'magic' mode,
in which instead of engaging in traditional pvp players draft powerful magic
spells & abilities to fight each other in a more chaotic and arcane bloodbath.
